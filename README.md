# Red-Team-vs-Blue-Team
Assessment, Analysis,  and Hardening of a Vulnerable System

Red Team vs. Blue Team scenario in which I played the role of both pentester and SOC analyst.
As the Red Team, I did attack a vulnerable VM in the environment, ultimately gaining root access to the machine. As Blue Team, I used Kibana to review logs taken during the Red Team scenario. Used the logs to extract hard data and visualizations for the report/presentation.

Then, used my log data to suggest mitigation measures for each exploit successfully performed.

Please enjoy the presentation!
